It produces consistent results across time, samples, and sub-samples within the survey itself. Reliable surveys are not necessarily accurate though. A valid survey accurately measures its latent variable. Its results are compatible with established theory and with other measures of the concept. Valid surveys are usually reliable too.\nReliability can entail one or more of the following:\nThere are three assessments of validity:\nSurvey considerations\nQuality of Measurement: Reliability and Validity (internal and external)\nPretest and pilot test\nProbability Sampling: - simple random, systematic random, stratified random, cluster, and multistate cluster. - power analysis\nReporting - Descriptive statistics - Write-up\nContinuous latent variables (e.g., level of satisfaction) can be measured with factor analysis (exploratory and confirmatory) or item response theory (IRT) models. Categorical or discrete variables (e.g., market segment) can be modeled with latent class analysis (LCA) or latent mixture modeling. You can even combine models, e.g., satisfaction within market segment.\nIn practice, you specify the model, evaluate the fit, then revise the model or add/drop items from the survey.\nA full survey project usually consists of six phases.2",

Survey items measuring the same latent variable are highly correlated. Use the Cronbach alpha test and split-half test to assess internal consistency (see Section @ref(itemreduction) on item reduction).\nStability (aka Test-retest). Repeated measurements yield the same results. You use the test-retest construct to assess stability in the Replication phase.\n\n\n\nContent validity.

    "text": "2.2 Item Generation\nDefine your latent variable(s), that is, the unquantifiable variables you intend to infer from variables you can quntify. E.g., “Importance of 401(k) matching”\nAfter you generate a list of candidate survey items, enlist SMEs to assess their inter-rater reliability with Cohen’s Kappa and content validity with Lawshe’s CVR.\n\n2.2.1 Cohen’s Kappa\nAn item has inter-rater reliability if it produces consistent results across raters. One way to test this is by having SMEs take the survey. Their answers should be close to each other. Conduct an inter-rater reliability test by measuring the statistical significance of SME response agreement using the Kohen’s kappa test statistic.\nSuppose your survey measures brand loyalty and two SMEs answer 13 survey items like this. The SMEs agreed on 6 of the 13 items (46%).\n\n\nShow the code\nsme %&gt;% mutate(agreement = RATER_A == RATER_B)\n\n\n   RATER_A RATER_B agreement\n1        1       1      TRUE\n2        2       2      TRUE\n3        3       2     FALSE\n4        2       3     FALSE\n5        1       3     FALSE\n6        1       1      TRUE\n7        1       1      TRUE\n8        2       1     FALSE\n9        3       2     FALSE\n10       3       3      TRUE\n11       2       3     FALSE\n12       1       3     FALSE\n13       1       1      TRUE\n\n\nYou could measure SME agreement with a simple correlation matrix (cor(sme)) or by measuring the percentage of items they rate identically (irr::agree(sme)), but these measures do not test for statistical validity.\n\n\nShow the code\ncor(sme)\n##           RATER_A   RATER_B\n## RATER_A 1.0000000 0.3291403\n## RATER_B 0.3291403 1.0000000\nirr::agree(sme)\n##  Percentage agreement (Tolerance=0)\n## \n##  Subjects = 13 \n##    Raters = 2 \n##   %-agree = 46.2\n\n\nInstead, calculate the Kohen’s kappa test statistic, \\(\\kappa\\), to assess statistical validity. Cohen’s kappa compares the observed agreement (accuracy) to the probability of chance agreement. \\(\\kappa\\) &gt;= 0.8 is very strong agreement, \\(\\kappa\\) &gt;= 0.6 substantial, \\(\\kappa\\) &gt;= 0.4 moderate, and \\(\\kappa\\) &lt; 0.4 is poor agreement. In this example, \\(\\kappa\\) is only 0.32 (poor agreement).\n\n\nShow the code\npsych::cohen.kappa(sme)\n\n\nCall: cohen.kappa1(x = x, w = w, n.obs = n.obs, alpha = alpha, levels = levels, \n    w.exp = w.exp)\n\nCohen Kappa and Weighted Kappa correlation coefficients and confidence boundaries \n                 lower estimate upper\nunweighted kappa -0.18     0.19  0.55\nweighted kappa   -0.13     0.32  0.76\n\n Number of subjects = 13 \n\n\nShow the code\npsych::cohen.kappa(sme2)\n\n\nCall: cohen.kappa1(x = x, w = w, n.obs = n.obs, alpha = alpha, levels = levels, \n    w.exp = w.exp)\n\nCohen Kappa and Weighted Kappa correlation coefficients and confidence boundaries \n                 lower estimate upper\nunweighted kappa -0.22     0.17  0.56\nweighted kappa    0.30     0.56  0.83\n\n Number of subjects = 13 \n\n\nUse the weighted kappa for ordinal measures like Likert items (see Wikipedia).\n\n\n2.2.2 Lawshe’s CVR\nAn item has content validity if SMEs agree on its relevance to the latent variable. Test content validity with Lawshe’s content validity ratio (CVR),\n\\[CVR = \\frac{E - N/2}{N/2}\\] where \\(N\\) is the number of SMEs and \\(E\\) is the number who rate the item as essential. CVR can range from -1 to 1. E.g., suppose three SMEs (A, B, and C) assess the relevance of 5 survey items as “Not Necessary”, “Useful”, or “Essential”:\n\n\n  item            A            B            C\n1    1    Essential       Useful Not necesary\n2    2       Useful Not necesary       Useful\n3    3 Not necesary Not necesary    Essential\n4    4    Essential       Useful    Essential\n5    5    Essential    Essential    Essential\n\n\nUse the psychometric::CVratio() function to calculate CVR. The threshold CVR to keep or drop an item depends on the number of raters. CVR should be &gt;= 0.99 for 5 experts; &gt;= 0.49 for 15, and &gt;= 0.29 for 40.\n\n\nShow the code\nsme2 %&gt;% \n  pivot_longer(-item, names_to = \"expert\", values_to = \"rating\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(item) %&gt;% \n  summarize(.groups = \"drop\",\n            n_sme = length(unique(expert)),\n            n_ess = sum(rating == \"Essential\"),\n            CVR = psychometric::CVratio(NTOTAL = n_sme, NESSENTIAL = n_ess))\n\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 4\n   item n_sme n_ess    CVR\n  &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     1     3     1 -0.333\n2     2     3     0 -1    \n3     3     3     1 -0.333\n4     4     3     2  0.333\n5     5     3     3  1    \n\n\nIn this example, items vary widely in content validity from unanimous consensus for to unanimous consensus against.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMiddleton, Fiona. 2022. “Reliability Vs.

    "text": "3.1.1 Continuous Values\nSuppose you estimate a population (univeral) mean, \\(\\bar{y}_U\\), from the mean of a simple random sample, \\(\\bar{y}_s\\). Under repeated sampling, the sample means would have variance related to the population variance, \\(S^2\\).\n\\[\nV(\\bar{y}_s) = \\left(1 - \\frac{n}{N} \\right) \\frac{S^2}{n}\n\\tag{3.1}\\]\nEquation 3.1 is the square of the standard error with a finite population correction factor (FPC), \\(1 - n / N\\). The FPC reduces the expected variance for small populations. In practice, the FPC is only important for sample size calculations when \\(n/N &lt; .05\\) - frequently the case in internal company surveys. \\(S\\) is an unknown population parameter estimated from the sample, \\(s\\), or by a rule of thumb.\nThe ratio \\(V(\\bar{y}_s) / \\bar{y}_U^2\\) is the square of the targeted coefficient of variation, \\(CV_0\\).\n\\[\nCV_0^2(\\bar{y}) = \\left(1 - \\frac{n}{N} \\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{n} \\cdot \\frac{S^2}{\\bar{y}_U^2}\n\\tag{3.2}\\]\nSolve Equation 3.2 for the required sample size to achieve \\(CV_0(\\bar{y}_s)\\).\n\\[\nn = \\frac{S^2 / \\bar{y}_U^2}{CV_0^2 + S^2 / (N \\cdot \\bar{y}_U^2)}\n\\tag{3.3}\\]\nThe numerator in Equation 3.3 is the population CV (a.k.a., unit CV).\nUse PracTools::nCont() to calculate \\(n\\). Setting the unit CV is somewhat of a chicken-and-egg problem since \\(S^2\\) and \\(\\bar{y}_U^2\\) are the population parameters you are estimating. Either rely on prior research or a best guess. The range rule of thumb is \\(S = \\mathrm{range} / 4\\). The targeted CV is usually set to 5% or 10%, or something better than prior research.\nExample. Prior experience suggests the unit CV is approximately \\(2\\). Your survey targets \\(CV_0(\\bar{y}_s) = 0.05\\).\nN defaults to Inf, fine for “large” populations.\n\nPracTools::nCont(CV0 = .05, CVpop = 2)\n\n[1] 1600\n\n\nFor a company survey, include N. for 10,000 employees you can survey a few less.\n\nPracTools::nCont(CV0 = .05, CVpop = 2, N = 10000)\n\n[1] 1379.31\n\n\nEven for a small population, you can still survey about half.\n\nPracTools::nCont(CV0 = .05, CVpop = 2, N = 1000)\n\n[1] 615.3846\n\n\nIf you don’t know CVpop or ybarU and S2, but have an expectation about ybarU and the range, use the range rule of thumb.\n\nPracTools::nCont(CV0 = .10, S2 = (abs(0 - 800) / 4)^2, ybarU = 100)\n\n[1] 400\n\n\nWhen does N become important? It depends on CV0, but N=20,000 seems to be upper limit.\n\n\n\n\n\nRequired sample size given population and CV requirements.\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, you can target a margin of error.\n\\[\nMOE = t_{(1-\\alpha), (n-1)} SE(\\bar{y})\n\\tag{3.4}\\]\nExample. You want a margin of error of 20. You estimate an overall range of 800.\n\nPracTools::nContMoe(moe.sw = 1, e = 20, S2 = (abs(0 - 800) / 4)^2) |&gt; ceiling()\n\n[1] 385\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Proportions\nIf the population parameter is a proportion, \\(p\\), the CV is\n\\[\nCV^2(p_s) = \\left(1 - \\frac{n}{N} \\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{n} \\cdot \\frac{N}{N-1} \\cdot \\frac{1 - p_U}{p_U}\n\\tag{3.5}\\]\nwhere \\(\\frac{N}{N-1} \\cdot \\frac{1 - p_U}{p_U}\\) is the square of the unit CV. When \\(N\\) is large, Equation 3.5 reduces to \\(CV^2(p_s) \\approx \\frac{1}{n} \\cdot \\frac{1 - p_U}{P_U}\\). From here you can see that \\(n\\) varies inversely with \\(p_U\\). PracTools::nProp() calculates \\(n\\) for proportions.\nExample. From prior experience you think \\(p_U = .01\\) and \\(N\\) is large. You set a targeted CV of \\(CV_0^2(p_s) = 0.05\\).\n\nPracTools::nProp(CV0 = .05, pU = .01)\n\n[1] 39600\n\n\nWhoa, \\(n\\) is huge!\nYou might choose to target a margin of error instead, \\(MOE = \\pm z_{1-\\alpha} \\cdot SE\\). Recall that \\(P(|p_s - p_U| &lt; MOE) = 1 - \\alpha\\). PracTools::nPropMoe() and PracTools::nContMoe() calculate \\(n\\) for MOEs.\nExample.

    "text": "3.2 Stratified SRS\nStratified samples partition the population by dimensions of interest before sampling. This way, important domains are assured of adequate representation. Stratifying often reduce variances. Choose stratification if i) an SRS risks poor distribution across the population, ii) you have domains you will study separately, or iii) there are units with similar mean and variances that can be grouped to increase efficiency.\nIn a stratified design, the measured mean or proportion of the population is the simple weighted sum of the \\(h\\) strata, \\(\\bar{y}_{st} = \\sum{W_h}\\bar{y}_{sh}\\) and \\(p_{st} = \\sum{W_h}p_{sh}\\). The population sampling variance is analogous,\n\\[\nV(\\bar{y}_{st}) = \\sum W_h^2 \\cdot \\left(1 - \\frac{n_h}{N} \\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{n_h} \\cdot S_h^2.\n\\tag{3.6}\\]\nUse the SRS sampling methods described in Section Section 3.1 to estimate each stratum.\nThe effect of stratification relative to SRS is captured in the design effect ratio,\n\\[\nD^2(\\hat{\\theta}) = \\frac{V(\\hat{\\theta})_\\mathrm{complex}}{V(\\hat{\\theta})_\\mathrm{SRS}}\n\\]\nExample.

    "text": "3.3 Power Analysis\nSection 3.1 and Section 3.2 calculated sample sizes based on the desired precision of the population parameter using CV, MOE, and cost constraints. Another approach is to calculate the sample size required to detect the alternative value in a hypothesis test. Power is a measure of the likelihood of detecting some magnitude difference \\(\\delta\\) between \\(H_0\\) and \\(H_a\\).2 Power calculations are best suited for studies that estimate theoretical population values, not for studies that estimate group differences in a finite population (Valliant 2013).\nA measured \\(t = \\frac{\\hat{\\bar{y}} - \\mu_0}{\\sqrt{v(\\hat{\\bar{y}})}}\\) test statistic would vary with repeated measurements and have a \\(t\\) distribution. A complication about the degrees of freedom arises in survey analysis. It is usually defined using a rule of thumb: \\(df = n_{psu} - n_{strata}\\). So if you have 10 strata and 100 PSUs per stratum, \\(df\\) would equal 1,000 - 100 = 900.\nExample. Suppose you want to measure mean household income for married couples. From prior research, you expect the mean is $55,000 with 6% CV. You hypothesize \\(\\mu\\) is greater than $55,000, but only care if the difference is at least $5,000.\nThe 6% CV implies SE = 6% * $55,000 = $3,300. Supposing \\(\\sigma\\) = $74,000, the original research would have use a sample of size n = \\((\\$74,000 / \\$3,300)^2\\) = 503.\nDon’t use n = 503 for your sample though. The probability of measuring a sample mean &gt;= $60,000 with an acceptable p-value is the power of the study. For n = 503 the power is only 0.448. The area of 1 - \\(\\beta\\) in the top panel below is only pnorm(qnorm(.95, 50000, 3300), 55000, 3300, lower.tail = FALSE) = 0.448. To achieve a 1-\\(\\beta\\) = .80 power, you need n = 1,356. That’s what the bottom panel shows. Notice that a sample mean of $59,000 still rejects H0: \\(\\mu\\) = $55,000. The power of the test tells you the sample size you need to draw a sample mean large enough to reject H0 1-\\(\\beta\\) percent of the time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe power of the test from the original study was only 0.448.\n\npower.t.test(\n  type = \"one.sample\",\n  n = 503, \n  delta = 5000, \n  sd = 74000, \n  sig.level = .05, \n  alternative = \"one.sided\"\n)\n\n\n     One-sample t test power calculation \n\n              n = 503\n          delta = 5000\n             sd = 74000\n      sig.level = 0.05\n          power = 0.4476846\n    alternative = one.sided\n\n\nWith such a low power of the study, a sample mean of $59,000 isn’t large enough to reject H0. Its p-value would be pt(q = (59000-55000)/(74000/sqrt(503)), df = 503 - 1, lower.tail = FALSE) = 0.113. To find the right sample size, use the power calculation with 1 - \\(\\beta\\) and n unspecified.\n\npower.t.test(\n  type = \"one.sample\",\n  delta = 5000, \n  sd = 74000,\n  sig.level = .05,\n  power = .80,\n  alternative = \"one.sided\"\n)\n\n\n     One-sample t test power calculation \n\n              n = 1355.581\n          delta = 5000\n             sd = 74000\n      sig.level = 0.05\n          power = 0.8\n    alternative = one.sided",

    "text": "3.4 Appendix: Bias\nA consideration not explored here, but which should be on your mind is the risk of bias. Here are a few types of bias to beware of (Lau 2017).\n\nCoverage bias. The sampling frame is not representative of the population. E.g., school club members is a poor sampling frame if target population is high school students.\nSampling bias. The sample itself is not representative of the population. This occurs when response rates differ, or sub-population sizes differ. Explicitly define the target population and sampling frame, and use systematic sampling methods such as stratified sampling. Adjust analysis and interpretation for response rate differences.\nNon-response bias. Responded have different attributes than non-respondents. You can offer incentives to increase response rate, follow up with non-respondents to find out the reasons for their lack of response, or compare the characteristics of non-respondents with respondents or known external benchmarks for differences.\nMeasurement bias. Survey results differ from the population values. The major cause is deficient instrument design due to ambiguous items, unclear instructions, or poor usability. Reduce measurement bias with pretesting or pilot testing of the instrument, and formal tests for validity and reliability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLau, C. Kuziemesky, F. 2017.

The response weights will always be the same, equaling the population size divided by the sample size. Typically, the response weight is identified in a column.

For each school type, a simple random sample of schools was taken: \\(n_E\\) = 100, \\(n_M\\) = 50, and \\(n_H\\) = 50. The 100 elementary schools represent 100 / 4,421 of the state’s elementary schools, so their weights = 44.21.

    "text": "4.6 Item Reduction\nThe third phase, explores the mapping of the factors (aka “manifest variables”) to the latent variable’s “dimensions” and refines the survey to exclude factors that do not map to a dimension. A latent variable may have several dimensions. E.g., “brand loyalty” may consist of “brand identification”, “perceived value”, and “brand trust”. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA), identifies the dimensions in the data, and whether any items do not reveal information about the latent variable. EFA establishes the internal reliability, whether similar items produce similar scores.\nStart with a parallel analysis and scree plot. This will suggest the number of factors in the data. Use this number as the input to an exploratory factor analysis.\n\n4.6.1 Parallel Analysis\nA scree plot is a line plot of the eigenvalues. An eigenvalue is the proportion of variance explained by each factor. Only factors with eigenvalues greater than those from uncorrelated data are useful. You want to find a sharp reduction in the size of the eigenvalues (like a cliff), with the rest of the smaller eigenvalues constituting rubble (scree!). After the eigenvalues drop dramatically in size, additional factors add relatively little to the information already extracted.\nParallel analysis helps to make the interpretation of scree plots more objective. The eigenvalues are plotted along with eigenvalues of simulated variables with population correlations of 0. The number of eigenvalues above the point where the two lines intersect is the suggested number of factors. The rationale for parallel analysis is that useful factors account for more variance than could be expected by chance.\npsych::fa.parallel() compares a scree of your data set to a random data set to identify the number of factors. The elbow below here is at 3 factors.\n\n\nShow the code\npsych::fa.parallel(brand_rep)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParallel analysis suggests that the number of factors =  3  and the number of components =  2 \n\n\n\n\n4.6.2 Exporatory Factor Analysis\nUse psych::fa() to perform the factor analysis with your chosen number of factors. The number of factors may be the result of your parallel analysis, or the opinion of the SMEs. In this case, we’ll go with the 3 factors identified by the parallel analysis.\n\n\nShow the code\nbrand_rep_efa &lt;- psych::fa(brand_rep, nfactors = 3)\n# psych::scree(brand_rep) # psych makes scree plot's too.\npsych::fa.diagram(brand_rep_efa)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing EFA, you may tweak the number of factors or drop poorly-loading items. Each item should load highly to one and only one dimension. This one dimension is the item’s primary loading. Generally, a primary loading &gt; .7 is excellent, &gt;.6 is very good, &gt;.5 is good, &gt;.4 is fair, and &lt;.4 is poor. Here are the factor loadings from the 3 factor model.\n\n\nShow the code\nbrand_rep_efa$loadings\n\n\n\nLoadings:\n               MR2    MR1    MR3   \nwell_made       0.896              \nconsistent      0.947              \npoor_workman_r  0.739              \nhigher_price    0.127  0.632  0.149\nlot_more               0.850       \ngo_up                  0.896       \nstands_out                    1.008\nunique                        0.896\none_of_a_kind   0.309  0.295  0.115\n\n                 MR2   MR1   MR3\nSS loadings    2.361 2.012 1.858\nProportion Var 0.262 0.224 0.206\nCumulative Var 0.262 0.486 0.692\n\n\nThe brand-rep survey items load to 3 factors well except for the one_of_a_kind item. Its primary factor loading (0.309) is poor. The others are either very good (.6-.7) and excellent (&gt;.7) range.\nLook at the model eigenvalues. There should be one eigenvalue per dimension.

The 4 factor loading only loaded one variable to the fourth factor. In this example the SME expected a three-factor model and the data did not contradict the theory, so stick with three.\nWhereas the item generation phase tested for item equivalence, the EFA phase tests for internal reliability (consistency) of items. Internal reliability means the survey produces consistent results. The more common statistics for assessing internal reliability are Cronbach’s Alpha, and split-half.\n\n\n4.6.3 Cronbach’s Alpha\nIn general, an alpha &lt;.6 is unacceptable, &lt;.65 is undesirable, &lt;.7 is minimally acceptable, &lt;.8 is respectable, &lt;.9 is very good, and &gt;=.9 suggests items are too alike. A very low alpha means items may not be measuring the same construct, so you should drop items. A very high alpha means items are multicollinear, and you should drop items. Here is Cronbach’s alpha for the brand reputation survey, after removing the poorly-loading one_of_a_kind variable.\n\n\nShow the code\npsych::alpha(brand_rep[, 1:8])$total$std.alpha\n\n\n[1] 0.8557356\n\n\nThis value is in the “very good” range. Cronbach’s alpha is often used to measure the reliability of a single dimension. Here are the values for the 3 dimensions.\n\n\nShow the code\npsych::alpha(brand_rep[, 1:3])$total$std # Product Quality\n## [1] 0.8918025\npsych::alpha(brand_rep[, 4:6])$total$std # Willingness to Pay\n## [1] 0.8517566\npsych::alpha(brand_rep[, 7:8])$total$std # Product Differentiation\n## [1] 0.951472\n\n\nAlpha is &gt;0.7 for each dimension. Sometimes the alpha for our survey as a whole is greater than that of the dimensions. This can happen because Cronbach’s alpha is sensitive to the number of items. Over-inflation of the alpha statistic can be a concern when working with surveys containing a large number of items.\n\n\n4.6.4 Split-Half\nUse psych::splitHalf() to split the survey in half and test whether all parts of the survey contribute equally to measurement. This method is much less popular than Cronbach’s alpha.\n\n\nShow the code\npsych::splitHalf(brand_rep[, 1:8])\n\n\nSplit half reliabilities  \nCall: psych::splitHalf(r = brand_rep[, 1:8])\n\nMaximum split half reliability (lambda 4) =  0.93\nGuttman lambda 6                          =  0.92\nAverage split half reliability            =  0.86\nGuttman lambda 3 (alpha)                  =  0.86\nGuttman lambda 2                          =  0.87\nMinimum split half reliability  (beta)    =  0.66\nAverage interitem r =  0.43  with median =  0.4",

CFA measures construct validity, that is, whether you are really measuring what you claim to measure.\nThese notes explain how to use CFA, but do not explain the theory. For that you need to learn about dimensionality reduction, and structural equation modeling.\nUse the lavaan package (latent variable analysis package), passing in the model definition. Here is the model for the three dimensions in the brand reputation survey. Lavaan’s default estimator is maximum likelihood, which assumes normality.

Criterion validity is a measure of the relationship between the construct and some external measure of interest. Measure criterion validity with concurrent validity, how well items correlate with an external metric measured at the same time, and with predictive validity, how well an item predicts an external metric. Stability means the survey produces similar results over repeated test-retest administrations.\n\n4.9.1 Criterion Validity\n\n4.9.1.1 Concurrent Validity\nConcurrent validity is a measure of whether our latent construct is significantly correlated to some outcome measured at the same time.\nSuppose you have an additional data set of consumer spending on the brand. The consumer’s perception of the brand should correlate with their spending.

Clustering does not mean distance-based clustering, such as K-means, in this context. Mixture models consider data as coming from a distribution which itself is a mixture of clusters. To learn more about model-based clustering in the Hierarchical and Mixed Effects Models DataCamp course.\nFactor scores can be extracted from a structural equation model and used as inputs in other models. For example, you can use the factor scores from the brand reputation dimensions as regressors for a regrssion on spending.\n\n\nShow the code\nbrand_rep_fs_reg_dat &lt;- bind_cols(brand_rep_cfa_scores, spend = brand_rep$spend)\nbrand_rep_fs_reg &lt;- lm(spend ~ PrdQl + WillPay + PrdDff, data = brand_rep_fs_reg_dat)\nsummary(brand_rep_fs_reg)$coef\n\n\n             Estimate Std.

A construct, once validated, can be combined with a wide range of outcomes and models to produce valuable information about consumer behavior and habits.\n\n\n\n4.9.2 Test-Retest Reliability\nTest-retest reliability is the ability to achieve the same result from a respondent at two closely-spaced points in time (repeated measures).\nSuppose you had two surveys, identified by an id field.\n\n\nShow the code\n# svy_1 &lt;- brand_rep[sample(1:559, 300),] %&gt;% as.data.frame()\n# svy_2 &lt;- brand_rep[sample(1:559, 300),] %&gt;% as.data.frame()\n# survey_test_retest &lt;- psych::testRetest(t1 = svy_1, t2 = svy_2, id = \"id\")\n# survey_test_retest$r12\n\n\nAn r^2 &lt;.7 is unacceptable, &lt;.9 good, and &gt;.9 very good. This one is unacceptable.\nOne way to check for replication is by splitting the data in half.\n\n\nShow the code\n# svy &lt;- bind_rows(svy_1, svy_2, .id = \"time\")\n# \n# psych::describeBy(svy, \"time\")\n# \n# brand_rep_test_retest &lt;- psych::testRetest(\n#   t1 = filter(svy, time == 1),\n#   t2 = filter(svy, time == 2),\n#   id = \"id\")\n# \n# brand_rep_test_retest$r12\n\n\nIf the correlation of scaled scores across time 1 and time 2 is greater than .9, that indicates very strong test-retest reliability. This measure can be difficult to collect because it requires the same respondents to answer the survey at two points in time. However, it’s a good technique to have in your survey development toolkit.\nWhen validating a scale, it’s a good idea to split the survey results into two samples, using one for EFA and one for CFA. This works as a sort of cross-validation such that the overall fit of the model is less likely due to chance of any one sample’s makeup.\n\n\nShow the code\n# brand_rep_efa_data &lt;- brand_rep[1:280,]\n# brand_rep_cfa_data &lt;- brand_rep[281:559,]\n#  \n# efa &lt;- psych::fa(brand_rep_efa_data, nfactors = 3)\n# efa$loadings\n# \n# brand_rep_cfa &lt;- lavaan::cfa(brand_rep_mdl, data = brand_rep_cfa_data)\n# lavaan::inspect(brand_rep_cfa, what = \"call\")\n# \n# lavaan::fitmeasures(brand_rep_cfa)[c(\"cfi\",\"tli\",\"rmsea\")]",

The schools in apistrat are stratified based on the school type E = Elementary, M = Middle, and H = High School. For each school type, a simple random sample of schools was taken: \\(n_E\\) = 100, \\(n_M\\) = 50, and \\(n_H\\) = 50. The 100 elementary schools represent 100 / 4,421 of the state’s elementary schools, so their weights = 44.21. Similarly, the weights are 50 / 1,018 = 20.36 for the middle schools, and 50 / 755 = 15.10 for the high schools.\n\n\nShow the code\napistrat %&gt;% \n  count(stype, pw, fpc) %&gt;% \n  mutate(`pw*n` = pw * n) %&gt;%\n  adorn_totals(,,,, -pw) %&gt;% \n  flextable() %&gt;% colformat_num(j = 2, digits = 2) %&gt;% colformat_int(j = c(3:5))\n\n\nstypepwfpcnpw*nE44.20999908447274,4211004,421H15.100000381469775550755M20.36000061035161,018501,018Total-6,1942006,194\n\n\nHere is the design object.\n\n\nShow the code\napistrat_design &lt;- svydesign(\n  data = apistrat, \n  weights = ~pw, \n  fpc = ~fpc, \n  ids = ~1, \n  strata = ~stype\n)\nsummary(apistrat_design)\n\n\nStratified Independent Sampling design\nsvydesign(data = apistrat, weights = ~pw, fpc = ~fpc, ids = ~1, \n    strata = ~stype)\nProbabilities:\n   Min. 1st Qu.
