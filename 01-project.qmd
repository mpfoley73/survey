## Sources of Error

When planning for a new survey project, be aware of these sources of error [@zimmer2024]:

-   **Coverage Error**: The sampling frame from which participants are selected isn't representative of the target population.
-   **Sampling Error**: The difference between all potential samples under the same sampling method.
-   **Nonresponse Error**: Differences between responders and non-responders to the survey (unit nonresponse) or a question (item nonresponse).
-   **Adjustment Error**: Error introduced during post-survey statistical adjustments.
-   **Validity**: A question doesn't quite measure the research topic.
-   **Measurement Error**: An answer doesn't quite appropriate to the question.
-   **Processing Error**: The researcher makes invalid edits when cleaning and coding the responses.

## Survey Planning Document

A survey project will benefit from clearly thinking through the questions it aims to answer and how the survey will answer them. The sections below are a kind of project planning document template.

-   **Project Title**: \[Name of the survey project\].

    > *2024 Market Trends Survey*

-   **Stakeholders**: \[List all primary business groups and stakeholders\].

    > *Marketing, Product Development, and Sales Teams*

-   **Survey Objective**: \[Outline what you aim to learn or measure with this survey\].

    > *To understand consumer interest in emerging product features to inform 2025 product line decisions.*

    > *Ages 25-45, primarily located in urban areas across North America*.

-   **Sample Size and Sampling Method**: Desired number of respondents, sampling method (e.g., random, stratified, etc.). If using a stratified design, consider selection weighting responses in the analysis phase. Selection weights are usually constructed so that the sum of weights equals the population size. Weights also often account for nonresponse rates.

    > *Target sample size of 1,000 respondents, with stratified sampling by age group and location to ensure diverse representation.*

-   **Criteria for Participation**: \[Specific qualifications for respondents, such as existing customers, location, or other demographics\].

    > *Combination of multiple-choice, Likert scale, and a few open-ended questions for qualitative insights.*

-   **Estimated Time for Completion**: \[Average time it should take respondents to complete the survey\].

    > *Approximately 5-7 minutes*

-   **Question Development**: Provide a list of tentative questions or topics; ensure they align with objectives. It may be helpful to first outline the topics and state why each question or topic is important to the research question(s) [@zimmer2024]. To maximize the validity of the questions, consider piloting questions to a test group. Item selection is discussed more fully in @sec-item-selection.

    > *“How likely are you to purchase a product with \[Feature X\]?” (Scale: Very Unlikely to Very Likely)*
    >
    > *“What factors influence your decision to purchase this type of product?” (Check all that apply)*
